<p>Hi! I am Arnav Kansal. I am passionate about Machine Learning, high-performance systems and their applications in technology and finance. In the past I have worked on the Linux Kernel, Low Level HFT software, x86 Simulators, recommendation systems, NLP, Economics of a small cafe, etc. In general, I like to solve challenging, real life problems. <br/>

I am set to join <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber </a> in their freight team this summer as a Software Engineer. I have been very lucky to experience the frontier of cutting edge tech be it at Tech or Financial firms. Last summer during my Masters at NYU Courant, I interned at <a href="https://www.citadelsecurities.com/" target="_blank">Citadel Securities</a> in their Low Latency Technologies team. Prior to that during my undergrad, I have also had the opportunity to work at <a href="https://www.samsung.com/in/aboutsamsung/home/" target="_blank">Samsung Electronics</a> on the scheduler of the linux kernel for one of their Android smartphones (Samsung C7) as a summer intern.

<p>I am a graduate student at <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu" target="_blank"> NYU,</a> <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu" target="_blank">Courant School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, where I am pursuing a Masters in Computer Science, where I am working with Professor <a href="http://www.mzahran.com/" target="_blank">Zahran </a> on developing a self learning AI support for architecture which optimises tunables in the HW at runtime for any application. Before this, I graduated from <a href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Delhi </a> in Electrical Engineering. Back in IIT, I worked with Prof.<a href="http://web.iitd.ac.in/~jayadeva/index.html" target="_blank"> Jayadeva </a> on various aspects of machine learning(ranking systems) and recommendation systems. My <a href="../pdfs/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> from IITD.

<h3>My hobbies</h3>

<p>I am learning to play an electric guitar and also like to cook in my spare time. I like to play soccer and enjoy running. 
<br/> <br/>
During graduate school, I was living in Manhattan, NY where I found a new love for coffee and here are some nice places to get <a href="../coffee.html" target="_blank">coffee</a> while in the big apple.

Also, included are some<a href="../brunch.html" target="_blank"> brunch </a> places I love!
<br/> <br/>
I am always excited to know about the next generation video games and the latest gaming PCs that can be built to play them. I once successfully overclocked an Intel E8400 Dual Core to 4.0 Ghz from its base clock of 3.0 Ghz.
